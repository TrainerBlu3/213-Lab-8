Learning outcomes:
A class is like a blueprint which can be used to create objects. This blueprint defines the structure of objects.
Therefore an object is an instance of a class which can have its own properties and functions.
Constructors are used to setup and initialize values when the object is created.
An example of when to use inheritance can be taken right from the lab where we created a textbook that extends book.
