Learning outcomes:
A class is like a blueprint which can be used to create objects. This blueprint defines the structure of objects.
Therefore an object is an instance of a class which can have its own properties and functions.
Constructors are used to setup and initialize values when the object is created.
An example of when to use inheritance can be taken right from the lab where we created a textbook that extends book. The textbook has all the same features and characteristics as a regular book but we add a subject to separate it from a regular book.
We use a constructor to initialize the properties of the books such as the title and author. With the constructor these get initialized upon creation.
Static properties can be used to across the class by all the objects that are created from that class. An example of how this could be used would be to count how many book objects have been created in total from the class.
